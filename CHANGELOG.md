## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `active` event on `Worker` and `TestWorker` — emitted with `(job, jobId)` when a job starts processing.
- `drained` event on `Worker` and `TestWorker` — emitted when the queue transitions from non-empty to empty (i.e. no more waiting jobs after the last active job completes). A new `isDrained` flag prevents repeated emissions.
