## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `queue.drain(delayed?)` — remove all waiting jobs from the queue without touching active jobs. Pass `true` to also remove delayed/scheduled jobs. Implemented as a single Valkey Server Function call; emits a `'drained'` event (#15).
- `TestQueue.drain(delayed?)` — in-memory equivalent; removes waiting (and optionally delayed) jobs from `TestQueue`.
- `active` event on `Worker` and `TestWorker` — emitted with `(job, jobId)` when a job starts processing.
- `drained` event on `Worker` and `TestWorker` — emitted when the queue transitions from non-empty to empty (i.e. no more waiting jobs after the last active job completes). A new `isDrained` flag prevents repeated emissions.
- `queue.clean(grace, limit, type)` — bulk-remove old `completed` or `failed` jobs by minimum age. Returns an array of removed job IDs. Implemented as a single Valkey Server Function call (#16).
- `job.discard()` — immediately move an active job to failed state, bypassing retries (#14).
- `UnrecoverableError` — throw this error class inside a processor to skip all remaining retry attempts and fail the job permanently (#14).
- `job.changePriority(newPriority)` — re-prioritize a waiting, prioritized, or delayed job after enqueue. Setting priority to `0` moves it back to the normal stream. Throws if the job is active, completed, or failed (#13).
- `job.changeDelay(newDelay)` — mutate the fire time of a delayed job after enqueue. Setting delay to `0` promotes immediately (to waiting or prioritized depending on priority). Setting delay > 0 on a waiting or prioritized job moves it to the scheduled ZSet. Throws if the job is active, completed, or failed (#12).
- `job.promote()` — move a delayed job to waiting immediately. Always moves to the waiting stream regardless of priority (unlike `changeDelay(0)` which preserves priority scheduling). Priority metadata is kept in the job hash. Throws if the job is not in the delayed state (#11).
- `queue.retryJobs(opts?)` — bulk-retry failed jobs in a single Valkey Server Function call. Pass `{ count: N }` to limit the number of jobs retried, or omit to retry all. All retried jobs go to the scheduled ZSet (the promote cycle moves them to the stream). Returns the count of retried jobs (#17).

### Fixed

- `job.retry()` — now removes the job from the failed ZSet before adding to scheduled, and resets `attemptsMade` and `finishedOn`.

## [0.7.0]

### Added

- Sandboxed processor: run worker processor in a child process or worker thread (`sandboxed: true` option). Protects the main process from processor crashes and memory leaks (#36).
- Sandbox pool stress tests (#37).

### Fixed

- Resolved 4 source bugs and 12 flaky test files (#34).

---

## [0.6.0]

### Added

- Comprehensive README rewrite: star CTA, install command, expanded feature list, differentiators (#35).

---

## [0.4.0]

Initial public release on npm.

- Valkey Server Functions for all queue operations (FUNCTION LOAD + FCALL).
- Hash-tagged keys for cluster compatibility.
- XREADGROUP + consumer groups + PEL for at-least-once delivery.
- `completeAndFetchNext` single-RTT job transition.
- FlowProducer workflows: `chain`, `group`, `chord`.
- Schedulers: cron and interval repeating jobs.
- Rate limiting, deduplication, compression, retries, DLQ.
- Per-key ordering, global concurrency, job revocation.
- QueueEvents stream-based lifecycle events.
- In-memory `TestQueue` and `TestWorker` (no Valkey needed).
- OpenTelemetry tracing, per-job logs.
